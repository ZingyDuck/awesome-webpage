    <h1 class="Mason" >Welcome to Page 2!</h1>

    <p class="Carl" >Currently, I am a student at Penang Free School or some call it SMK Penang Free in 7th grade/Form 1, where I enjoy their wide selection of curriculum to join like the Computer Club or the Volleyball Club.
        <br> 
        My passion for coding has led me to be involved with the school Computer Club.
        <br>
        With a strong interest in Visual Arts, Iâ€™ve already started thinking about a future in a creative field where I can use my imagination to make art.
        <br> 
        School life has been full of exciting discoveries and friendships, and I enjoy learning new things each day.</p>
