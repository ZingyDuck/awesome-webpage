    <p class="Carl">
        I was born and raised in Georgetown, Penang, Malaysia, growing up with a love for drawing and painting.<br> I learned from an early age to be determined, meaning to make a decision or come to a conclusion about something.
        <br>
        Some of my favorite early memories are of our family traditions, all of which helped me develop a sense of curiosity and excitement for learning.<br> Being close to family has shaped my perspective and helped me find comfort and inspiration in all things around me.
