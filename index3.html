    <h1>Welcome to Page 3!</h1>

<p class="Stan">When not studying or at school, I mostly spend my time on my computer playing video games or drawing whatever comes to mind.
        <br>
     These hobbies are a big part of my life, providing a creative outlet and a way to unwind.
     <br>

I'm also a licensed ham radio operator, which lets me connect with people worldwide, explore new technologies, and learn about communication hands-only. 
<br>
Through radio, Iâ€™ve met interesting people and found a sense of community that has fueled my curiosity and love for learning.
<br>
In the future, I dream of traveling the world and becoming an artist or a software engineer. 
<br>
Driven by curiosity and a big imagination, I am excited about all the possibilities ahead. 
<br>With a love for learning, I know that with hard work and passion, anything is possible.</p>
